# Credit-Card-Transactions-Fraud-Detection-Project
 This project focuses on evaluating and testing several classification models  in detecting fraudulent and non-fraudulent credit card transactions. The objective is to test the model on under sampled and oversampled datasets to determine how well it can predict both types of transactions, ensuring that legitimate transactions are not incorrectly flagged as fraud.
